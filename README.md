# DeepNetMusicMaker

This code was written for ELEC 576 - Intro to Deep Learning - at Rice University.

It contains three methods for training neural networks to generate novel music.

1. Baseline.py is the default method, re-created from an article found on Medium.
2. MusicGAN.ipynb contains a method for training a generative adversarial network for this task.
3. rnn_music.py is a multi-feature/non-sequential method. 

The midi_data folder has a number of Bach compositions used to train the network. 

You can listen to the generated results at: https://soundcloud.com/user-747548100/sets/music-written-by-neural.
